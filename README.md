# uninstall-microsoft-edge
A simple batch script which uninstalles edge

# How does it work?
This is a rather simple soltion, it simply "breaks" microsoft edge, by deleting the files required for the web browser, while leaving files for apps which require edge to run, such as the new outlook app.

### Disclaimer
This windows update can still re-install the web browser, so this program may have to be ran again.
It tends to take 2-3 months before it is reinstalled from my testing
